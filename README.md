# Flow Computation Framework scheduler

## Problem
For the current flow computation, the computation DAG has to be well defined. 
However when the number of computers increasing, it wourl become harder and harder to schedule the resources.

## Assumption
In a highly unstable network of computing nodes, the cost of communication would be high and various. 

By introducing a self envolving network DAG, we could release the main node from much scheduling job. 

## Expected Result
It would make fault torrlence much easier to handle.

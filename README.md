## Problem
For the current flow computation, you have to first well define the DAG. 
However when the number of computers increasing, it wourl become harder and harder to schedule the resources. 


## Assumption
By introducing a self envolving network DAG, we could release the main node from much scheduling job. 
## Expected Result
It would make fault torrlence much easier to handle.
